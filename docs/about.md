LLVM GPU News is a newsletter focused on the GPU side of the LLVM project, including areas like GPU backends, LLVM and MLIR middle-end work for GPU targets, out-of-monorepo GPU compilers (e.g., LLPC, SYCL, ROCm), related conference talks, etc.

Our goal is to make the GPU communities less fragmented by surfacing common issues and challenges in LLVM-based GPU compilers. We also hope to shed some light on the ongoing issues and development efforts in the GPU world and expose to this the general LLVM community.

We welcome your feedback and suggestions, see the bottom of the page for details on how to submit suggestions and contribute.
