## Industry News and Community Events


##  LLVM and Clang

### Discussions

* Sameer Sahasrabuddhe posted an [RFC on 'Uniformity Analysis for Irreducible Control Flow'](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-uniformity-analysis-for-irreducible-control-flow/64139). This is a generalization of divergence analysis that included irreducible control flow. The proposed analysis is [implemented as a template that can be used by both LLVM IR and Machine IR](https://reviews.llvm.org/D130746).

### Commits

* DirectX/HLSL/DXIL support:
  * Move support for `dxil::TypedPointerType` to LLVM core IR. [D130592](https://reviews.llvm.org/D130592)
  * Added a a new HLSL builtin, `__builtin_hlsl_create_handle`, to create pointers out of resource handles. [D130016](https://reviews.llvm.org/D130016)
  * Added initial support for the `RWBuffer` type. [D128569](https://reviews.llvm.org/D128569), [D130017](https://reviews.llvm.org/D130017), [D130019](https://reviews.llvm.org/D130019)
  * Added initial `ResourceType` documentation. [D130794](https://reviews.llvm.org/D130794)
  * Added support for the `-E` compilation option that specifies the entry point. [D124751](https://reviews.llvm.org/D124751)
* `SPIRVBaseInfo*` was reimplemented with TableGen. The previous approached was based on macros. [D130518](https://reviews.llvm.org/D130518)


## MLIR

### Discussions

* The SPIR-V dialect is planned to be renamed from `spv.` to `spirv.`, while vendor-specific operations from `spirv.<OpName><Vendor>` to `spirv.<Vendor>.<OpName>`. This will be a non-functional change. [LLVM#56863](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/56863)

### Commits

*  A new `spv.IAddCarry` op was defined. [D131281](https://reviews.llvm.org/D131281)


## OpenMP (Target Offloading)

### Discussions

* Shilei Tian proposed to [update the C++ standard to 17 for `libopmtarget`](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-update-c-standard-to-17-for-libomptarget/64310). There are no replies at the time of writing.
* Guilherme Valarini posted an RFC on ['Re-scheduling implicit tasks for non-blocking target `nowait` execution'](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-re-scheduling-implicit-tasks-for-non-blocking-target-nowait-execution/64239).

### Commits


## External Compilers

### LLPC

* Multiple changes advancing the mesh shader support.
