Welcome to LLVM GPU News, a bi-weekly newsletter on all the GPU things under the LLVM umbrella.
This issue covers the period from July 8 to July 22, 2022.

We welcome your feedback and suggestions. Let us know if we missed anything interesting, or want us to bring attention to your (sub)project, revisions under review, or proposals. Please see [the bottom of the page](https://llvm-gpu-news.github.io/about/) for details on how to submit suggestions and contribute.


## Industry News and Community Events

* Lavapipe, a software Vulkan implementation, is now [Vulkan 1.3 conformant](https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products#submission_696).


##  LLVM and Clang

### Discussions

* More discussion on support for typed pointers on [discourse](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-better-support-for-typed-pointers-in-an-opaque-pointer-world/63339) and [during the last LLVM GPU Working Group meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m_oSe1HwtWdQ2JUmMRTAVHbUS7Dv4MRsqptiYcgK6iI/edit#bookmark=id.kd3brjs5gbxm). Nikita Popov is fine with having [typed pointer types for DXIL/SPIR-V/etc. as long as they do not get exposed via the IR or bitcode](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-better-support-for-typed-pointers-in-an-opaque-pointer-world/63339/26).  Joshua Cranmer suggested that the [SPIR-V pointer type strategy and ABI need to be decided before typed pointer can be removed from LLVM](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-better-support-for-typed-pointers-in-an-opaque-pointer-world/63339/28).
* Following a [discussion on passing undefined values as function parameters in CUDA/HIP programs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m_oSe1HwtWdQ2JUmMRTAVHbUS7Dv4MRsqptiYcgK6iI/edit#bookmark=id.kd3brjs5gbxm), Krishna Chaitanya Sankisa posted an [RFC on introducing a `maybe_undef` function attribute](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/llvm-dev-rfc-d130224-introduce-maybe-undef-attribute-for-function-arguments-which-accepts-undef-values/63980).
* Bartłomiej Cieślar is doing an internship at Facebook and is [looking at adding support for device- and host-specific clang-tidy checks for CUDA](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/cuda-support-for-clang-tidy/64023). They are looking for reviewers, both for their high-level plan and future code reviews.

### Commits

* `nvgpu.ldmatrix` and `nvgpu.mma.sync` ops gained better verification. [D129669](https://reviews.llvm.org/D129669), [D129400](https://reviews.llvm.org/D129400)
* Added the `amdgpu.lds_barrier` op. [D129522](https://reviews.llvm.org/D129522)
*  The `VectorToROCDL` pass was removed. [D129308](https://reviews.llvm.org/D129308)
* `spv.GLSL.*`/`spv.OCL.*` ops were renamed to `spv.GL.*`/`spv.CL.*` ops for better consistency. [D130194](https://reviews.llvm.org/D130194), [D130280](https://reviews.llvm.org/D130280)


## OpenMP (Target Offloading)

### Discussions

* The LLVM GPU Working Group discussed [a device libm/libc/libc++ implementation and where to place it](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m_oSe1HwtWdQ2JUmMRTAVHbUS7Dv4MRsqptiYcgK6iI/edit#bookmark=id.kd3brjs5gbxm). Alexey Bader suggested to look at the [Intel's implementation for SYCL](https://github.com/intel/llvm/tree/sycl/libdevice) which uses the LLVM license and is ]compatible with libstdc++ and Microsoft's C libraries](https://github.com/intel/llvm/blob/a0bfab17b94064a7aa7fe12d105d29d22cf86e1f/sycl/doc/extensions/supported/C-CXX-StandardLibrary.rst).
