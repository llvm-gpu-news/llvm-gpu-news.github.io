Welcome to LLVM GPU News, a bi-weekly newsletter on all the GPU things under the LLVM umbrella.
This issue covers the period from May 14 to June 3 2022.

We welcome your feedback and suggestions. Let us know if we missed anything interesting, or want us to bring attention to your (sub)project, revisions under review, or proposals. Please see [the bottom of the page](https://llvm-gpu-news.github.io/about/) for details on how to submit suggestions and contribute.


## Industry News and Community Events
* The Asahi Linux's open source GPU driver can now [draw a 'hello triangle' on Apple M1](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Asahi-Linux-First-Triangle).


##  LLVM and Clang

### Discussions

* The LLVM GPU Working Group met on May 20 and discussed: the impact of opaque pointer os GPU code generation targets, memory kind operand on fence instructions, new driver linking CUDA upstream with LTO and applying to HIP / SYCL, and address-space-aware alias analysis. The meeting notes are available in the [agenda doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m_oSe1HwtWdQ2JUmMRTAVHbUS7Dv4MRsqptiYcgK6iI/edit#heading=h.8o7325w9hybv).
* The discussion on 'Setting version, environment, and extensions for SPIR-V target' continued. Jaebaek Seo and Nicolai HÃ¤hnle [mentioned the problem of features enabled by either vendor-specific and cross-vendor extensions](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/setting-version-environment-and-extensions-for-spir-v-target/62018/2).

### Commits

* The SPIR-V target now supports setting the SPIR-V version via target triple, e.g. `spirv64v1.4-unknown-unknown`. [D124776](https://reviews.llvm.org/D124776)
* Added the `-Xoffload-linker` flag to forward linker arguments to the device link job. [D126226](https://reviews.llvm.org/D126226)
* Added the `--offload-link` flag to instruct the driver to use the linker-wrapper. [D126398](https://reviews.llvm.org/D126398)
* The new offloading driver now only builds the offloading actions with a source input. [D125705](https://reviews.llvm.org/D125705)
* Introduced a fallback scheme for externalizing static device variables in CUDA / HIP. [D125904](https://reviews.llvm.org/D125904)
* New HLSL and DirectX features:
   * Vector types were enabled for HLSL. [D125052](https://reviews.llvm.org/D125052)
   * HLSL target profile parsing was fixed. [D125585](https://reviews.llvm.org/D125585)
   * Added DXContainer (object file format for DXIL shaders) parsing code. [D124804](https://reviews.llvm.org/D124804)
   * Initial support for YAML representation of DXContainer files. [D123944](https://reviews.llvm.org/D124944)
* Added new AMDGPU intrinsics: `llvm.amdgcn.{raw|struct}.buffer.load.lds` and `llvm.amdgcn.global.load.lds intrinsic`. [D124884](https://reviews.llvm.org/D124884), [D125279](https://reviews.llvm.org/D125279)


## MLIR

### Discussions

### Commits

* `GpuParallelLoopMapping` was exposed as a non-test pass. [D126199](https://reviews.llvm.org/D126199)
* Fixed capability check for 64-bit element types in the SPIR-V dialect. [D12656](https://reviews.llvm.org/D126256)
* Added an option to lower NvGpu dialect ops during the `VectorToGPU` conversion pass. [D122940](https://reviews.llvm.org/D122940)


## OpenMP (Target Offloading)

### Discussions

* A [discussion](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/making-openmp-declare-target-static-global-variables-externally-visible/62670) on whether or not OpenMP should support updates to static variables on the device.

### Commits

* Added a new target to build the device runtime as a static library. [D125315](https://reviews.llvm.org/D125315)
* Changed device-LTO to use a static library version of the OpenMP runtime. [D125333](https://reviews.llvm.org/D125333)
* `atomic compare` and `atomic compare capture` are now supported. [D120290](https://reviews.llvm.org/D120290), [D120007](https://reviews.llvm.org/D120007), [D118632](https://reviews.llvm.org/D118632), [D120200](https://reviews.llvm.org/D120200), [D116261](https://reviews.llvm.org/D116261), [D118547](https://reviews.llvm.org/D118547), [D116637](https://reviews.llvm.org/D116637). Only integer variables are supported for now, floating point will be supported soon.


## External Compilers

### LLPC

* The work on mesh shaders continues. [LLPC#1814](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/llpc/pull/1814), [LLPC#1817](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/llpc/pull/1817), [LLPC#1821](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/llpc/pull/1821), [LLPC#1830](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/llpc/pull/1830), [LLPC#1834](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/llpc/pull/1834)
