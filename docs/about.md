LLVM GPU News is a bi-weekly newsletter focused on the GPU side of the LLVM project,
including areas like GPU backends, LLVM and MLIR middle-end work for GPU targets,
out-of-monorepo GPU compilers (e.g., LLPC, RADV, SYCL, ROCm), related conference
talks, etc.

Our goal is make the GPU communities less fragmented by surfacing common issues
and challenges in LLVM-based GPU compilers. We also hope to shed some light on the
ongoing issues and development efforts in the GPU world and expose to this the general
LLVM community.

We welcome your feedback and suggestions, see the bottom of the page for details on how
to submit suggestions and contribute.
