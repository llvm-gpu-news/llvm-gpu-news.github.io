Welcome to LLVM GPU News, a bi-weekly newsletter on all the GPU things under the LLVM umbrella.
This issue covers the period from April 2 to April 15 2022.

We welcome your feedback and suggestions. Let us know if we missed anything interesting, or want us to bring attention to your (sub)project, revisions under review, or proposals. Please see [the bottom of the page](https://llvm-gpu-news.github.io/about/) for details on how to submit suggestions and contribute.


## Industry News and Community Events

* N


##  LLVM and Clang

### Discussions

* A new document describing the plans for Clang HLSL Support has been posted on [Clang's documentation site](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/HLSLSupport.html)
* The HLSL effort is going to be using a [GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/llvm/projects/4/) to track progress publicly.

### Commits

* Added DXILPrepare CodeGen pass. [D122081](https://reviews.llvm.org/D122081)
* Added HLSL Semantic parsing. [D122699](https://reviews.llvm.org/D122699)
* HLSL does not support pointers or references. [D123167](https://reviews.llvm.org/D123167)
* (In-review) DXIL CodeGen:
  * Add DXIL Bitcode Writer and DXIL testing.[D122082](https://reviews.llvm.org/D122082)
  * Three additional patches add support for opaque pointers:
    * Add pointer type analysis. [D122268](https://reviews.llvm.org/D122268)
    * Update DXIL Prepare to emit no-op bitcasts. [D122269](https://reviews.llvm.org/D122269)
    * Convert opaque to typed pointers in DXIL emission. [D122270](https://reviews.llvm.org/D122270)
* (In-review) HLSL:
  * Add DXC driver mode and target profile flag. [D122865](https://reviews.llvm.org/D122865)
* The patches necessary to compile CUDA with the new driver is up for review [D123812](https://reviews.llvm.org/D123812). This enables the following features:
  - Full RDC-compilation with Clang.
  - LTO when using CUDA.
  - Static library support for CUDA.
  - Interoperability with OpenMP Offloading.

## OpenMP (Target Offloading)

### Discussions

* [A presentation on the new driver](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1A5-fkV-_pJEFtUenZaAaOOcb9-6n1u9s5JpuPQkfMqY/edit?usp=sharing) was given at the LLVM performance workshop.

### Commits

* A new binary format for the new driver was added [D122069](https://reviews.llvm.org/D122069). This is conceptually similar to CUDA's fatbinary format.
* The offloading sections used by the new driver are now `SHF_EXCLUDE` [D122987](https://reviews.llvm.org/D122987).
* Fixed a crash on AMDGPU involving multiple registers with DWARF information [D123717](https://reviews.llvm.org/D123717).
* Fixed the vectorizer's dependence on a bitcast instruction following opaque pointers.  [D123694](https://reviews.llvm.org/D123694).
