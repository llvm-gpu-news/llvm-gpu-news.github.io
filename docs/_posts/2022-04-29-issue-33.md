  - Update DXIL Prepare to emit no-op bitcasts. [D122269](https://reviews.llvm.org/D122269)
  - Convert opaque to typed pointers in DXIL emission. [D122270](https://reviews.llvm.org/D122270)
* Clang patches are under review for HLSL support.
  - Adding driver options to set the DXIL validation version. [D123884](https://reviews.llvm.org/D123884)
* Support HLSL access specifier behavior has landed. [D124487](https://reviews.llvm.org/D124487)

### Commits

* SPIR-V conversion now supports `memref.alloca` and `vector.reduction`. [D124542](https://reviews.llvm.org/D124542), [D124380](https://reviews.llvm.org/D124380)
* Unnecessary layout decorations are now removed for storage classes like `Function`, `Private`, etc. in SPIR-V. [D124543](https://reviews.llvm.org/D124543)


## OpenMP (Target Offloading)

### Discussions

### Commits

* The `LIBOMPTARGET_INFO` support now prints the name of globals declared on the device. [D124381](https://reviews.llvm.org/D124381)
* The new clang driver is now the default for OpenMP. It supports LTO with `-foffload-lto` and static library builds. [D122831](https://reviews.llvm.org/D122831)
* Compiling NVPTX offloading in LTO-mode now uses PTXAS's non-rdc mode if all inputs are bitcode. [D124292](https://reviews.llvm.org/D124292)
* Added support for interoperability with CUDA. This allows OpenMP to call CUDA device functions and vice-versa. [D120273](https://reviews.llvm.org/D120273)
