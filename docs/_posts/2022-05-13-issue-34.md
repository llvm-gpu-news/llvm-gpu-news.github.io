* The new driver can now compile CUDA code in RDC-mode and in LTO-mode using the new driver via `--offload-new-driver` flag. [D123812](https://reviews.llvm.org/D123812)
* HLSL and DXIL support:
    * The `half` type is now enabled in HLSL. [D124790](https://reviews.llvm.org/D124790)
    * The `-fcgl` flag was added to allow checking codegen output for HSLS. [D124983](https://reviews.llvm.org/D124983)
    * A pass to lower llvm intrinsics into DXIL op functions landed. [D124805](https://reviews.llvm.org/D124805)
    * A pass to emit DXIL metadata based on llvm IR metadata landed. [D125158](https://reviews.llvm.org/D125158)

## OpenMP (Target Offloading)

### Discussions

* Added a new `clang-offload-packager` tool to bundle offloading binaries together similar to CUDA's fatbinary. [D125165](https://reviews.llvm.org/D125165)
* Improved static library support for offloading, now only includes architectures that are used by the application. [D125092](https://reviews.llvm.org/D125092)
* OpenMP can now be compiled with multiple architectures at once via `--offload-arch`. [D124721](https://reviews.llvm.org/D124721)
* OpenMP can now infer the target triple from `--offload-arch` so `-fopenmp-targets=` is not always necessary. [D125050](https://reviews.llvm.org/D125050)
* Fixed an alignment bug when extracting archive members for offloading compilation. [42a1fb5ca](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/42a1fb5ca56c494e25419a97057a9526f3e8608d)

### Commits

* `atomicrmw` can be emitted when using `atomic update` with floating-point variables (FP32 and FP64). [D124724](https://reviews.llvm.org/D124724)


## External Compilers

### LLPC

* The standalone compiler `amdllpc` tool now links statically with [`spvgen`](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/spvgen). [LLPC#1774](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/llpc/pull/1774)
