* Improved the binary handling of the offloading section by adding a new ELF section [D129052](https://reviews.llvm.org/D129052).
* Introduced `!exclude` metadata to make globals use the `SHF_EXCLUDE` section flag to better support the offloading section [D129151](https://reviews.llvm.org/D129151).
* Added the `--offloading` option to `llvm-objdump` to display embedded device code in the offloading section, similar to `cuobjdump` [D126904](https://reviews.llvm.org/D126904).

### Commits

* `atomic compare` and `atomic compare capture` now support floating-point variables [D127041](https://reviews.llvm.org/D127041), [D127042](https://reviews.llvm.org/D127042).
* Fixed the issue that peer-to-peer memory copy on Nvidia GPU doesn't work [D122764](https://reviews.llvm.org/D122764).
* Heap2Stack (also used to remove globalized locals) is now loop-aware which often allows to place new allocas in the entry block. This can improve performance and avoid issues with stacksave/restore intrinsics introduced by the inliner. [commit1](https://reviews.llvm.org/rG07766f4070301072840b92c02c215391c7b5a870) and [commit2](https://reviews.llvm.org/rGcb26b01d57f50483df006af35f17167900c2dcd1).
* Implemented a unified interface for kernel launches in libomptarget [D128549](https://reviews.llvm.org/D128549) [D128817](https://reviews.llvm.org/D128817).
* Improved link times and temporary file handling in the linker wrapper by writing to disk only when necessary [D127246](https://reviews.llvm.org/D127246).
* Added an extention to `omp variant begin` that mangles function declarations as well [D124624](https://reviews.llvm.org/D124624).
* Reworked argument handling in the linker wrapper to make adding new arguments easier [commit](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/d2ead9e324d4d268e8c0634849d6081e177c9dd7).
